Heuristica is a beautiful, modern serif font created by Andrey V. Panov. I downloaded the .otf files from https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/heuristica and then uploaded them here. The four fonts in this family (regular, bold, italic, and bolditalic) can be accessed by linking to mikjakrych.github.io/heuristica/heuristica.css.
